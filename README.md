# Connected Sounds

#### By Megan Kaluza, Nhate Hoang, Alvaro Flores, Tam Nguyen - 11/9/2016

## Description

This project contains a search input field to find information on music artists utilizing Ember framework. The project implements Spotify Web API, incorporating artist, album, and track endpoints to return information on the music artist. We incorporated complementary colors for the design palette, reflecting the opposite colors of green and black from the Spotify application. Nevertheless, the project aims to provide the user a unique experience when searching artists and listening to music in a way that's  aesthetically pleasing.
